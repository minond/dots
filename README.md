#### dots

these are configuration files to most of the tools I use day to day. feel free
to take anything you'd like.

what I typically do clone this repo in my home directory by running
`cd; git clone http://github.com/minond/dots .dots` and make links between
files stored in here and files stored through out my system (mostly my home
directory). the `configure` script in the repo can be used to create those
links. you can run it without arguments to get a list of that it can link for
you. to link files just pass any of the listed options as arguments, like so:
`./configure vim tmux`

some screenshots of that some of those things look like:
