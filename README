These are configuration files to most of the tools I use day to day. Feel free
to take anything you'd like.

What I typically do is clone this repo in my home directory and make links
between the files stored in here (this repo) and files stored through out my
system (mostly my home directory).

The `configure` script in the repo can be used to create those links. You can
run it without arguments to get a list of that it can link for you. Once you're
ready to use a cofiguration, just run the script with the item name(s).

    $ cd
    $ git clone http://github.com/minond/dots .dots
    $ cd .dots
    $ ./configure --help
    Usage: ./configuration <flag|command|tool>

      Flags:
      --help, -h                    # View this help text

      Commands:
      install, i <repo> [path]      # Install a git submodule as a Pathogen plugin
      try, t <repo> [path]          # Clone/delete a git submodule as a Pathogen plugin
      update, u                     # Update dependencies (like Vim plugins)
      check, c                      # Display optional software information

      Tools:                        # git, vim, ctags, tmux, screen, bash, scala, chunkwm
